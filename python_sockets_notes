IPC Inter Process Communication

The socket() method

syntax is: socket(family, type, protocol)

There are two address family's:
AF_UNIX or AF_INET

type:
SOCK_STREAM gives connection-oriented
SOCK_DGRAM gives connectionless

protocol:
this is 0 by default and is good for all socket types other than raw.

so an example of a TCP socket would be:
TCP_Sock=socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM)

you can create a UDP socket as follows:
TCP_Sock=socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM)
